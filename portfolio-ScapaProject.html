                      <p class="">The Scapa project began in late 2008, and was a product of the ongoing development of Towed Streamer EM, the latest form of the EM technology first brought to market by MTEM.</p>
                      <p class="">MTEM was formed in 2004, acquired in 2007 by PGS and, in 2009, aiming to deliver the step change technology of fully integrated Towed Streamer EM within industry standard platforms, and with it a huge increases in scale, speed and data density.</p>
                      <p class="">Product development was ongoing across many streams; marketing teams shaping our message to a global client base, mechanical engineering delivering equipment, system research designing work flows to acquire data, research scientists investigating mathematical modeling techniques and a team of operational geophysicists developing processing pathways to deliver EM to the client.</p>

                      </div>
                      <p class="">Teams were located across the globe, with primary EM development based in Edinburgh, Stockholm and Oslo. In addition, a number of external research partners were contributing key elements to be integrated into our internal process.</p>
                      <p class="">Prior to Scapa, I had been a Project Lead in the EM Operations group, building and leading a team in successful delivery of client-focused projects. In support of this, I designed and developed a suite of new tools and methodologies. This experience afforded me an understanding the full breadth of the problem, which in turn fueled a broad ambition and highlighted opportunity across the scope of the product to support and push forward the delivery of Towed Streamer EM.</p>

                      <p class="">Company culture was heavily focused on development, both in terms of team and the focus of our products. Working within this environment we worked to define what product design means in the context of business software, what product design means for the Scapa project, and exploring approaches which bring creativity to the fore.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Learn Early, Learn Often</strong>
                        <p> New features released quickly and consistently, generating a feedback loop to confirm we are moving in the right direction. This approach develops a cadence that informs your work, a momentum that pushes a project forward.</p>
                      </p>
                      <p class=""> <strong>Think It. Build It. Ship It. Tweak It.</strong>
                      <p>Figure out what type of product we are building. Create a Minimum Value Product that is ready for use. Roll out to users and measure against metrics of success. Continuously improve the product based on feedback and development plan. This pattern reduces the risk of designing the wrong product.</p>
                      </p>
                      <p class=""> <strong>Think Big, Start Small</strong>
                      <p>Employ the 666 Timescale - 6 weeks / 6 Months / 6 Years - At 6 weeks, we understand exactly what we are working on and going to deliver. 6 months; we have aims discussed between groups, good intentions to develop these, with room to manoeuvere. 6 years; we outline our ambition, we are we headed and where we want to impact.</p>
                      </p>
                      <p class=""> <strong>Design for Progress, Not Outcomes</strong>
                      <p>Or how to deliver value over time, not single outcomes. We want the Scapa platform to support a growing, evolving product and so change needs to be part of its DNA and grasped as an opportunity to gain feedback and learn from it. The scientific method is naturally embedded in our product design, we question, research, test, analyse, repeat.</p>
                      </p>
                      <p class=""> <strong>Lagom</strong>

                      <p class="">We had delivered on a number of EM projects by this time, developing a tool set that supported our work flow. This tool set had grown, changed and adapted to a fast changing environment, becoming somewhat fragmented and misaligned in the process.</p>
                      <p class="">With Towed Streamer EM, the proposed advances in acquisition system and better integration with industry platforms, it was time for a serious rethink.</p>
                      <p class=""> We wanted to combine the experience and skills we already had, with a deeper commitment to delivering an efficient, integrated product fully realising the opportunities and expectations set by an huge increase in scale.</p>
                      <p class="">We began by stripping back to first principles, removing what we already knew and asking why, why and why again (and again and again ...) to better understand the core problem. Once we had stripped back to the core, we were then able to build back up with a better solution.</p>

                      <!-- <p class="mt-30"> <strong>What What Wanted To Learn</strong></p>
                      <p> - what was key functionality and how would our existing product change</p>
                      <p> - what were the opportunities of better integration with industry platforms</p>
                      <p> - where are we unique and how do we deliver that</p> -->

                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong><em>What We Learned</em></strong></p>
                      <p> I lead a series of interviews with key stakeholders across the full breadth of the EM group to gain a better understanding of the problem set.</p>

                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Adaptability</strong></p>
                      <p> EM remained a fast developing environment, with multiple streams of development and research operating in parallel. Our system, and team, would need to accept and adapt to this, providing a solid foundation that would grow with the technology, not hinder it. We needed to design for progress, not single outcomes.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>The Sales Pitch</strong></p>
                      <p> Working with the sales team highlighted the key differentiators that were being used to position PGS EM within the market; Efficiency and Integration with Industry Standards. It was clear to me that these be the pillars upon which the Scapa  project be built. If we could demonstrate efficiency in our work flows, adopt industry standards and ensure clean integration with other platforms then our product would be in a better shape to deliver and be adopted.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Align with Industry</strong></p>
                      <p> Discussions across groups confirmed that there was a company wide push to align and integrate with industry standards. Equipment was designed to fit on existing vessels, industry data types replaced the researcher's parameter file, and existing software was utilised in the work flow where possible. To be relevant, Scapa would need to build upon and integrate with these standards.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Efficiency and Repeatability</strong></p>
                      <p> In all interviews, we were reminded that with a huge increase in scope and data density, coupled with industry expectations of accuracy, any system would need to be both efficient in handling the work flow and have the option to easily repeat any past routines, performed by any member of the group independent of any specialised expertise.</p>

                      <p class=""> Scribbled on whiteboards, chanted in meeting rooms, "Clarity in Complexity" became the battle cry; These weren't going to be simple solutions. Efficient yes, focusing on ease of use sure, but within a web of connected systems and process that are inherently complex. </p>
                      <p class="">We reach a level where the complexity of running a 3D inversion becomes irreducible. We weren't looking to dumb down these process, but rather bring a sense of purpose and order to them. Forming connections between disparate elements, with the aim to meet the challenge of delivering EM efficiently and accurately.
                      </p>
                      <p class="">To better frame the design work in terms of the problem, the desired outcome, the unique requirements and how the solution meets those requirements I utilised the Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework.</p>
                      <p class="mtb-30 text-center">When____, I Want To_____, So I Can_____</p>
                      <p class="">This system allowed us to focus on the situation, motivation and forces faced by user groups. I found this preferable to User Stories as we had a closed group of internal users, educated in the technology, many of whom would contribute to the Scapa project over time. The JTBD framework helped us all to better identify, understand and, importantly, describe the challenges we faced in delivering EM to the client at a high level.</p>

                      <p class="">Building a library of JTBD examples, I recognized an opportunity to separate the existing garden shed of tools into distinct, defined products, sitting within the Scapa System platform. Each product is focused on completing a set of tasks, producing a deliverable that is distinct yet these share a common interface, made up of the same underlying components and all connect into a single data base, utilizing common data types and patterns.</p>

This was a repeatable pattern, independent of individual make up of data and so could form the backbone of an interface component, which itself could be applied to many areas across the product.

                      <p class=""> Using the process maps as a guide, i began sketching with pen & paper to explore how we might present the data as it flowed through the system. I sketched out some of the key views, workflows and interactions, trying to find common patterns and behaviour.</p>
                      <p class=""> Progress on the database definition helped to further refine the scope and type of data that would be available to us. This informed the generation of a number of library components, such as the coverage plot, index map selection, attribute scatter plots and discovery window.</p>

                      <p class=""> I worked quickly to deliver working code for early testing. I consistently jumped between sketching and coding to flesh out the ideas and confirm that these were valid solutions to the stated problem. Often it was by exploring the solution in code that I was able to fully understand the options open to me, especially in handling the data connections across separate code blocks.</p>
                      <p class="">Building a close relationship with the user group allowed me to be confident in working with them in developing the tools. Often i would deliver works in progress that together we would refine and reshape to reach the final tool. This approach was necessary as many of the external tools were themselves under development and so the Scapa project had to be adaptable and open to changes.</p>
                      <p>I enjoyed this way of working, it generated a momentum that fed into the design and a pattern of thinking that encouraged us to look for a commonality that was adaptable rather that situation specific solutions.</p>
                      <p>As the EM product matured, we identified more and more areas where the system could generate deliverables automatically. We also looked to incorporate more and more group generated MATLAB code, utilizing the Scapa framework to present custom code.</p>

                      <p>Having a suite of high level products mapped to criteria, we are able to understand and communicate the workflow to completion. By aligning our work toward these products we ensure we are consistently designing solutions that solve the correct problem.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Connect Database</strong></p>
                      <p>The introduction of a common database across all components was a key moment in delivering the Scapa platform. Now we could design for common events, structures and data types. It also opened the door to deeper analysis of the data, allowing us to pull in data that would compliment and inform the decision making process.</p>
                      <p class="mt-30"> <strong>Growing Old Together</strong></p>
                      <p>There was a conveyor belt of new functionality to be accomodated. Process was refined, work steps automated, elements removed entirely as the product matured. Scapa grew in scope yet reduced in complexity as we gained a better grasp of what the EM product was, allowing us to automate many steps which previously had been user intensive. The ultimate realisation of this was a fully scripted version which generated all standard deliverables from a single parameter file.</p>
